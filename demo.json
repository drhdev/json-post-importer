  "content": "<p>No-See-Ums are tiny, almost invisible mosquitoes that cause intense itching with their bites. They can become a real nuisance, especially in humid areas. However, there are effective measures to protect yourself from them. In this article, you will learn when No-See-Ums are active, whether they are dangerous, and which remedies truly help.</p>\n\n<!--more-->\n\n<h2>What Are No-See-Ums?</h2>\n<p>No-See-Ums are tiny biting midges from the family <i>Ceratopogonidae</i>. With a size of only 1–3 mm, they are difficult to detect, but their bites are all the more unpleasant. They are particularly common in coastal regions, swamps, and humid areas.</p>\n\n<h2>Are No-See-Ums Dangerous?</h2>\n<p>In most cases, No-See-Ums are merely annoying but not dangerous. Their bites cause intense itching, which can lead to skin inflammation if scratched. In tropical regions, there have been reports of disease transmission, but the risk to humans is relatively low.</p>\n\n<h2>When Are No-See-Ums Active?</h2>\n<p>These tiny insects are primarily active during the morning and evening hours. They avoid direct sunlight and prefer humid, windless environments. They are particularly aggressive at dusk and tend to bite frequently.</p>\n\n<h2>Effective Protection Against No-See-Ums</h2>\n<p>To protect yourself from No-See-Ums, you can take several measures:</p>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Long, light-colored clothing:</strong> Tightly woven fabrics prevent bites.</li>\n  <li><strong>Repellents:</strong> Products containing DEET, Picaridin, or lemon eucalyptus oil are effective.</li>\n  <li><strong>Fly screens & mosquito nets:</strong> Use extra fine mesh (less than 0.6 mm mesh size).</li>\n  <li><strong>Fans:</strong> No-See-Ums are weak fliers and avoid wind.</li>\n  <li><strong>Avoid water accumulation:</strong> Since they lay their eggs there, reducing standing water helps lower their population.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>Conclusion: How to Get Rid of No-See-Ums</h2>\n<p>Even though No-See-Ums do not transmit dangerous diseases, they are extremely bothersome. However, with the right clothing, suitable repellents, and simple environmental measures, you can effectively protect yourself from them. Especially in humid regions, you should be cautious at dusk and take appropriate precautions.</p>\n",
