Summarize the following conversation as an SEO-optimized WordPress article in JSON. Write in English and address the reader in the informal "you" form.  
Consider HTML formatting, internal and external links as well as a meaningful structure, and use only UTF-8 characters throughout the entire JSON.

### JSON Format:
{
  "title": "SEO-optimized title of the article",
  "content": "Here goes the complete HTML formatted article...",
  "status": "draft",
  "date": "2025-02-24T10:00:00",
  "categories": [BEST_CATEGORY_ID],
  "tags": [BEST_TAGS],
  "author": 1
}

### Requirements for `title`:
- Generate a **concise, SEO-friendly title** with relevant keywords.
- The title should be **50-60 characters long** (optimal for Google snippets).

---

### Requirements for `content`:
1. **General Structure & Formatting:**
   - The entire content must **never start with a heading**.
   - Divide the content into three logical parts: an introductory part, a detailed main part, and a concluding part – without the words "Introduction", "Main Part" or "Conclusion" appearing in the text.
   - **The introduction must always be formulated as a single complete paragraph.**
   - **Headings (starting with `<h2>`) may only be used in the main part.** In the concluding part, **exactly one `<h2>` heading** must precede the section.
   - Ensure that the entire content in the `content` field contains valid, correctly nested HTML code.
   - Make sure that double quotes and other characters are correctly escaped so that the JSON is fully compliant and in UTF-8.

2. **Introduction (about 3-4 sentences):**
   - Explain why the topic is relevant, whom it concerns, and which questions the users might have that the article answers.
   - The introduction ends with a `<!--more-->` tag to create a "read more" link in WordPress.

3. **Main Part:**
   - Explain the topic in detail, as if one friend were explaining something to another friend – friendly, personable, and yet factually correct.
   - Use `<h2>` headings in the main part where appropriate for better structure.
   - **Use lists (ordered `<ol>` or unordered `<ul>` lists) only if at least three related points can be sensibly grouped.** If there are fewer than three points, formulate them as a continuous sentence.

4. **Concluding Part:**
   - Summarize the most important findings and key messages from the main part in about 3-4 sentences.
   - There must be **exactly one `<h2>` heading** immediately before this concluding paragraph, which introduces this section.

5. **Code Examples & Syntax Highlighting:**
   - If code examples or listings are included, embed them so that the WordPress plugin “Enlighter – Customizable Syntax Highlighter” is used.  
     **Example:**  
     ```html
     <pre data-enlighter-language="python">
     def hello_world():
         print("Hello, World!")
     </pre>
     ```

   - "Python"
   - "Automation"
   - "Data Analysis"
   - "Hosting"
   - "Performance"
   - "Security"
   - "Web Development"

2. **Additionally determine 3-5 new tags from the content.**
   - If no new tags can be determined, use only the provided tags.
   - The tags should first be chosen from the provided list and then, if possible, supplemented by content-based additions.
